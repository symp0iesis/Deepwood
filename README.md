## New wild listening into the inner lives of trees

What if the pattern recognition ability of AI could help us gain deeper insights into nature? Deepwood explores how plant biosensors, machine learning and immersive audio can to take us closer to the hidden world of activity inside trees.

A first-stage prototype is being developed for Spring 2025, with partners Knowle West Media Centre and Hive IT. Supported by Digital Catapult.
